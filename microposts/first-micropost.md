I REALLY like breaking down new habits and goals into quarters. 

Who ever said it takes 21-30 days to form a new habit is a liar. Maybe in a perfect world where you have a totally free schedule every day of the week MAYBE you could get a solid habit in 30 days. But I find that finding the proper time to fit it in your schedule that will work week after week is hard, so it's okay to fail a bit at the start, just learn. 

Also, some stuff is going to take a year or so to actually see improvements, such as working out. Don't focus on the end goal, focus on the habit. Those months are going to come down the line whether you want it or not. Just focus in on today and this week and let the months roll in. You will hit a year WAY faster than you think, but when you think about it, it will seem way further away than it is. 

And DON'T overload yourself. So many self-help books talk about habit stacking, which is good, but the implementation isn't finding 20 things that work together and doing them all. Pick 3 things a year and give yourself an entire break quarter where you just keep on keeping on. Those years will stack up just like the months do, and before you know it a few years have passed and you are a much different and better person than when you started. 

Just my two cents that nobody asked for.
